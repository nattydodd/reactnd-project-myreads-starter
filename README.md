# MyReads Project

This project is built using React.js and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This "Book Tracking" app uses a book searching API which allows you to find and save books that you:
a) Want to Read
b) Are Currently Reading
c) Have Read Already

You can save these books onto your "shelves" in order to keep track for later. You can also move the books between shelves. For example, if you finish reading a book you can move it to the "Read" shelf, or if you no longer "Want to Read" a book, you can remove it from your shelf completely.

To run the app locally:

* `npm install`

Start the development server with:

* `npm start`
